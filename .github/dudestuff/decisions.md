# Dude Decisions

Durable project and process decisions that Dude should preserve.

## Entries

### Lanes And Onboarding

- Brainstorm-first workflow: `brainstorm/<slug>.md` is the file-based intake ledger before definition; feature definition is native under `specs/<feature>/`; `@dude track` is the normal handoff into Beads, and explicit manual import is a fallback.
- First-run default: one small feature through Definition Only. If the user wants implementation and does not explicitly ask for Beads, default to Lightweight Execution instead of requiring a three-way lane choice.
- Onboarding: in a fresh repo with no active `brainstorm/` or `specs/` artifacts, proactively open with the three-question sequence (one feature vs many, implement-now vs define, hard constraints). If the first substantive request already answers them, treat onboarding as satisfied and move on without re-asking.
- Ask humans only the questions that materially change scope, hard constraints, approvals, or routing.

### Lightweight And Tracked Execution

- Lightweight Execution model: when Beads is unavailable or intentionally not used, `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` is the first-class live markdown board. Canonical state lives in the phased task units below the optional Dude-generated board fence; the fenced `## Ready Now / In Progress / Blocked / Done` region is a derived view, not a second source of truth. Supporting checklist files stay advisory.
- Task units: prefer durable IDs such as `T001@a1b2c3d4` (legacy `T001` accepted during migration). Four canonical states: `[ ]`, `[~]`, `[!]`, `[x]`. Optional indented `deps:` and `blocked-by:` metadata lines are part of the canonical task unit. A bounded task may cover closely related code, tests, and docs when one fresh verification step proves the whole slice.
- Coordinator-only mutation: in Lightweight Execution only the coordinator mutates task-state glyphs and task metadata, after fresh verification evidence or routed workflow changes; specialists report results back. During Beads-tracked execution only the coordinator calls `bd close`.
- After Beads import: Beads is the single live execution board and `tasks.md` is reference-only. Parallel execution is an internal coordination decision during Beads work, not a user-managed workflow step.

### Definition Packages

- Lean by default: create only artifacts that materially apply to the feature; omit placeholder files for non-applicable domains.
- `specs/` numbering is monotonic — use `max existing prefix + 1` and never reuse deleted numbers.
- `status:`, `spec_path:`, and `## Coordinator Log` (legacy name: `## Definition Record`) are Dude-maintained workflow metadata.

### Guardrails

- Project-wide guardrails live in `.github/dudestuff/guardrails.md`. When only bundle defaults exist, `@dude-spec-lead` may infer minimal candidate guardrails from repo and definition context (kept minimal for clearly solo or exploratory repos); the user may `skip` to continue with bundle defaults only. If inference yields no new project-specific guardrails, definition continues without a separate guardrail pause.

### Optional Disciplines

- Optional disciplines (worktrees, TDD) are opt-in and not part of the default workflow. Worktrees may be recommended only for risky/high-churn or truly independent parallel work where isolation has a concrete benefit; if a user declines, do not repeat the suggestion in the same session unless conditions materially change.

### Verbs And Blockage

- Workflow verbs: `draft`, `define`, `track`, `flag`, `status`, `diff`, and `self-check` are primary. `hire`, `remember`, `remove`, `import`, and explicit manual import remain available as coordinator-maintenance verbs. `import` covers single-artifact pulls (one agent or one skill at a time) via the `dude-bundle-import` skill; whole-bundle save/deploy stays in `dude-portability`. `@dude status` is read-only across all lanes; Beads details appear only when tracked execution has started.
- Blockage classification: typed prefixes are preferred (`spec-gap`, `plan-gap`, `contract-mismatch`, `test-failure`, `external-dependency`); plain-language blocker reports are accepted when the intended type is clear.

### Identity And Reconciliation

- Canonical feature identity is shared across definition and execution: brainstorm `spec_path` must match the Beads issue description `spec:` prefix (see `dude-spec-import-to-beads` `## Canonical Feature Identity`). If `spec_path` changes after import — or after Lightweight Execution has already recorded checked task history — reconcile first; prefer durable task keys, then fall back to task ID, story label, and core intent. If still ambiguous, pause `@dude track`, report surviving versus changed or ambiguous completions, and ask the user to confirm which checkmarks survive.

### Release

- Tag-driven release versioning is the project standard for both GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines: derive the package version from the `v*` tag before packaging, and sync `package.json` plus `package-lock.json` back to the default branch (direct push when allowed, PR fallback when branch protection blocks it).
